In this video we explore how we can use CreatorKit - a self-hosting alternative to Disqus to add comments, voting
and moderation to any existing page or blog post.

CreatorKit is especially useful for adding dynamic post comment and voting features to Jamstack and other
statically generated websites which can continually be statically pre-rendered and hosted on CDN's whilst its 
dynamic features are powered by an external CreatorKit instance.
