Razor Press is a **Razor Pages** and **Markdown** powered alternative to Ruby's Jekyll & Vue's VitePress 
that's ideal for generating fast, static content-centric & documentation websites. 
Inspired by VitePress, it's designed to effortlessly create documentation around content written in Markdown, 
rendered using C# Razor Pages that's beautifully styled with **tailwindcss** and **@tailwindcss/typography**.

Learn how Razor Press aids in the easy creation, and deployment of your statically generated sites that 
can be hosted for FREE on GitHub Pages CDN.
