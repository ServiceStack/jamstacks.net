In this engaging video tutorial, we showcase the power of the ServiceStack Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) template and 
demonstrate how the combination of typed end-to-end services and Blazor is ideal for building line of business applications. 

Blazor WASM is a cutting-edge framework that enables developers to build full-featured, high-performance 
web applications using C# and .NET, running directly in the browser via WebAssembly. 

The template provides a clean separation of concerns, typed end-to-end safety, and rapid iteration, 
thanks to the shared C# language, Visual Studio Hot Reload, and ServiceStack's message-centric design.
