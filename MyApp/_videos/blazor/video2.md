In this tutorial, we provide a walkthrough of the Blazor Web Assembly template that utilizes Tailwind CSS, and 
show you how to set up hot reload for both during development. Blazor Web Assembly is a powerful framework that allows 
developers to create high-performance web applications using C# and .NET, running directly in the browser via WebAssembly. 

Tailwind CSS, on the other hand, is a popular utility-first CSS framework that provides a comprehensive set of 
pre-defined CSS styles, enabling developers to create modern and responsive designs with ease.
