In this video tutorial, we'll walk through the process of creating universal Blazor API components for Blazor Server 
and Blazor WASM using the ServiceStack.Blazor library.

applications without worrying about which hosting model is used. This allows developers to streamline their development 
process and reduce the amount of code they need to write, making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.
