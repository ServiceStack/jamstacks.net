In this walkthrough, we will introduce you to the new Blazor WASM Bootstrap template, an exceptional option for 
development teams with strong C# skills who are building Line of Business (LOB) applications and seeking a 
superior developer experience. 

Blazor WASM is a cutting-edge framework that enables developers to build full-featured, high-performance web applications 
using C# and .NET, running directly in the browser via WebAssembly. The template comes with illustrative examples 
of a Bookings CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) system utilizing ServiceStack AutoQuery, as well as a simple 
Todo app functionality, allowing you to see how the different components of client-server communication 
can be effectively put together.
