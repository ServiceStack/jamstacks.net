In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive walkthrough of how to deploy your ServiceStack application using the 
Blazor WASM template with SQLite and Litestream to any Linux server with SSH access, Docker, and docker-compose. 

The Blazor WASM template is a powerful tool that allows developers to build high-performance web applications 
using C# and .NET, running directly in the browser via WebAssembly. By incorporating SQLite and Litestream, 
developers can ensure data integrity and reduce the risk of data loss in the event of a system failure or other issues.
